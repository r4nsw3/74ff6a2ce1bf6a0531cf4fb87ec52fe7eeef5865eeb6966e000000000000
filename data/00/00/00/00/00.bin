    Contra: Rogue Corps is a twin stick, third-person action game drawing
    upon its roots in fast and focused combat developed for the Xbox One,
    PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. From the director of Contra III:
    The Alien Wars and Contra: Hard Corps, Nobuya Nakazato instills more
    than 25 years of franchise pedigree into Contra: Rogue Corps with
    enormous crazed enemies, over-the-top violence, and a cast of diverse
    playable characters that add to the irreverent tone of the game. 

    Several years after the events of the Alien Wars, Contra: Rogue Corps
    follows a former military group living on the fringes as bounty 
    hunters and treasure finders in the Damned City. Survival requires 
    fast reactions, powerful weapons and the occasional organ and 
    cybernetic augmentation. Players will complete missions in PVE 
    campaigns, gathering resources to upgrade their guns to stay alive in
    the Damned City. If all else fails... bring in a friend and mow-down
    enemies together in online and local multiplayer modes!

    Features:
    - Action shooter with fast-paced, run and gun style gameplay 
    - Choose from 4 diverse characters with their own unique skills and
      specialty attacks - determine weapons load out, customise and craft
      unique weapons and create a perfect symphony of destruction 
      throughout the Damned City 
    - Operation Room – Upgrade characters and abilities, augmenting each
      with improved organs and cybernetics
    - PVE – Deep single player Story campaign mode chock-full of 
      challenging missions among hordes of enemies. Go solo or group with
